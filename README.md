## Basic virus with C

The purpose of the virus is simple. Only the Debugger works secretly and creates a text file called haha.txt in \AppData\Roaming in the Windows environment and prints "HAHA BEKO" 15000 times. "Operations completed!" It tells the user that the process is finished (MessageBox can be removed to make it work hidden).
